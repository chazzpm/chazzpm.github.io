# Blog: aNatureTechnologies Intelligent-Cognitive-Synergestic Football aFICS - Charles R Paez

**Football** is a *spatial evolutionary game* that in our Academia Emeritense FC culture, a synergestic environment and ethical standards are relevant traits that must characterize the *style or identity of our aFICS synergons and aFICS teams*.  

*Synergestic* or "cooperative willingly under compromise" trait has to survive the intense competition during a match and a
tournament. If the spatial distribution allows to cooperators to interact with each other frequently, the benefits of
cooperation will outweigh the losses due to exploitation by selfish players. 

However, to establish a collective synergestic behavior in an aFICS team,  

- it needs to be found initially in a sufficiently large cluster to allow a high frequency of intra-cooperator interactions
- At the same time, a tit-for-tat policy is used as ethical standard to  penalize selfish defectors players.

This two criteria explain how the evolution of an aFICS team overcomes the emergence problem of collective and coherent
cooperation. We assure those specific environmental conditions as *a silent culture of synergy and its reinforcement*. 
It tolerates the recurrent presence of a neutral behavior of selfish players that does not harm or does improve the 
performance of the aFICS team immerse in the synergestic stress of our cultural environment and its ethical standard.

These ideas summarizes the *dimensions of intelligent, cognitive and synergestic aFICS football* used to develop and evolve
at Academia Emeritense FC our aFICS synergons and aFICS teams.  

## In the blog

I explore using *data science analytics and machine learning ML technics* **how is that we can all live in the same 
Football's universe yet see reality so differently**. I will adopt *science's mindset* to walk through in this phenomenon 
of aFICS football.
