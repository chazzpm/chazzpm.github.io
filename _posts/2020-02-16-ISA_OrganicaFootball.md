## 5.1. Affordances, Landscape Fitness and aFICS Literacy

Gon is learning to explore and exploit the PB_landscape. He is instructed to perceive the environment in behavioral terms.
The **set of things** (goals, patch-zones, the ball) **provides oportunities for agency to move or play**, or **affordances**
in order to answer the great question: **What is to play football?**  that only depends of his own aFICS skills and his
football action capabilities. 

Affordances are properties of the coupled dynamical systems Gon-PB_Landscape, scaled to his action capabilities (strength,
speed, reaction times, height, weight, body dimensions) and, affordances are perceived by Gon as he learn to establish a
**Gon-PB_Landscape fit**. 

Academia Emeritense knows that its first cognitive task in Gon's aFICS footbal education is help him to acquiere the idea of
perceive the patched landscape, and later the pitch, in relation to its functionality. Its meaning is in the affordances that
provide insights in what Gon learns and how he accomplished the motor task with open inteligence that guides the decision
making process of how and when to act.

Gon and AcEmFC know that **learning a skill** must be understood as the emergence of an adaptive, functional dynamic and
constrained relation between he and his football environment fitness. This **fit** is influenced by a set of constrains,
always present, due to
- His individual biophysical, emotional, mental and psycological constrains and,
- Environmental physical, patch-inherents constrains and most important its set of affordances offered to him in any event

All of them must be used and exploited by Gon as opportunities for his agency in the PB_Landscape and his actions will be
observed by the head coach HC as a _metric_ of his basic **aFICS literacy**.

In this perspective, Gon involves understanding of his whole body - embodied - with affordances offered by the PB_landscape
- embedded - will determine his agency or task performance in the ground play. aFICS literacy is the _metric_ used during his
aFICS **synergon development process** until he left Academia Emeritense FC. Literacy must be understood by our talents as
'*being educated*' in our aFICS vision in the language game in the community.

Moreover, the perception of affordances evolves and changes as capability for skilled action improves. It is our 
responsability to offer, in the physical plant of our institution, through deliberate design facilities for enhance motor
skills improvement.

Let me help any player an aid that expand his vision of the invisible that Clement Lengled does not consider... after all, 
on the PB_landscape we see affordances and plays, not data.

## 5.2. Graph Model of the Interior of the Patched Landscape

Let us move from the bounded landscape model of the aFootball Universe with a perimeter and an interior space to a more strict
idea of an empty patched landscape without perimeter and **just constitued for interior space**. This landscape called
**aPLandscape** has eighteen patch-zones {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17} and fifty five bidirectional spatial-
adjacency relationships between patches, included 18 spatial-adjecency self-relations of the patches themselves. 
The aPLandscape is shown in Figure 5.1. and modeled as the network graph PL in Figure 5.2.

## 5.3. Affordance of Organic aFootball: Core-Convex_Hull Subspace Control
The organization of space into meso subspaces sets reveals the existence of a terrain **hierarchy** of affordances in the
aPLandscape that invites to responds with plays and tasks propers of an **organic aFootball style and strategy**. One in which
a **core-modulus** is a positional set up in order to plays in the inner subspace and with a larger **membrane-modulus** 
positional set up. One possisioned in a kind of convex closure of a shape that contains all outter patches. It is the **convex
hull**, a geometric concept that emerges from the space architecture as a kind of *complexity of the landscape*. An invitation
to move and play the ball in this convex hull that currently separates inner and outter subspaces and, with a subsumed core
modulus.

## 5.4. Network Properties of Space Architecture of aPLandscape

The network properties of PL graph, the relational model of the aPLandscape's interior, shows 18 nodes representing patches
and  324 interactions of i-adjacency length, where i in {0,1,2,3,4,5} range. The total length of those interactions is 714 and
the average shortest path length 2.0454545454545454

There are 1132 possible Gon's moves|passes of the ball from the centroid of each patch to the centroid of other patch, stasis
included in the interior of the aPLandscape.

### 5.4.1 Organization of Space in Meso Subspaces Sets
Other organization of the interior subscape in aPLandscape identifies an adjacency mesh between patches in which emerge {own-
box, inner, outter, opponent box} meso subspaces whose structure is clearly identificable.

![](/images/inaFootball_1Neighborhood.png "Figure 5.4. aFootball Adjacency Between Patches Create Meso Subspaces ")

Another organization of the interior subspace in aPLandscape identifies other adjacency mesh between patches of meso subspaces
{Own, Them, Both} that divides the landscape in own field and their field and the complete field can be seen as a both teams
subspace.

### 5.4.2. Value of Control Patch Subspaces 
Today, one main problem of the football analytical community ask how to value the distint zones of a football field taking
into account its control importance for the expected goal possibility. Figure 5.6. shown an intrinsic score goal value of each
patch in function of its degree or number of adjacent patches and distance to the center of the opponent goal.
