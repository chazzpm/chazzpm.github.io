## 4.1. Gon on-Ball Conducts Through the Bounded Landscape
Gon is on control of the ball in an arbitrary alpha point and is free to goes through the bounded landscape creating a 
sequence of intentional skill actions on his body and on the ball conducting it around with a final destination in an omega 
point where he can end up the effective final action to score a goal.

    - The set of _things_ is a tuple: {goals,ball}
    - The set of _agents_ is a singleton: {Gon}
    - The set of _events_ is: {stasis, transf0, transf1, ..., transfn} = {Ball's positional-stasis, Gon's positional-change,
    Ball-positional-change, ..., goal}
Gon has to develop a **set of actions** or intentional skills to execute on himself and on the ball in the landscape as shown
in the animation of Figure 4.1..

Gon's _positional change_ is a movement that can be classified as {standing, walking, jogging, running} to qualify the 
velocity and acceleration of Gon's position from point _p_ to gain point _o_ in open space and take control of the ball.

The last cognitive lessons that Gon acquiered were that
- the _main static reference of aFICS_ are **the goals** and, 
- the _main dynamic references of aFICS_ is the **ball location** and the **direction of movement**
- the main objective is the effective contralateral action with which Gon scores the goal

In his perception of the events in the landscape he must havethose lessons into account but mainly the recall of the AcEmFC
trainer that he must **finally conduct the ball in contralateral direction** and to **execute an end-up effective 
contralateral action to score**.

Gon needs a **model of the bounded landscape** that guides his decision making in any point in the environment he is off-ball
or 0n-ball control. But, Gon now knows that is a huge effort that all space-time is created and happen on only himself. He
**needs team mates to do it one and again and again**.

## 4.2. Architecture of Space of the Bounded Landscape
### 4.2.1. The Patched Bounded Landscape
In aFootball our perspective of the game is in spatial-temporal terms. This view yields us to state that _there is an
**architecture of the football game** in the bounded landscape. This architecture of aFICS in the bounded landscape is all
about **creating space guided by affordances** and **coming into space at the right time**. 

Therefore, a main idea of strategy to play football in the bounded playground is about **organizing space**. A spatial
practice in geolocalization, as in aFICS for football, to be analysed would be in terms of:
- the static framed bounded landscape or the **aBLandscape** and,
- the teams' dynamics as **Football Flow**

Let us analyse the framed bounded landscape aBLandscape as the common reference for spatial practice of football.
