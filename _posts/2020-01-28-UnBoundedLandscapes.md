## 3.1. Gon's Cognition of the Unbounded Landscape
### 3.1.1. The Universe of Football's Big-Bang
For Gon the Universe of Football's Big-Bang happens when he sees a ball in the open, for first time. For us, when he enters in 
our empty natural 105mx68m pitch for first time and his trainer invites him to experience it as an unbounded landscape. 
 
### 3.1.2. The Unbounded Landscape
- Gon experiences the *proto-state* of a non-phenomenical unbounded landscape with no space-time, where there is neither things (no ball, no goals, no stadium, etc) nor human beings (no players, no head coaches, no arbiters, no spectators, etc), and therefore nor events.
    - The set of _things_ is empty: {}
    - The set of _agents_ is empty: {}
    - The set of _events_ is empty: {}

**Gon** is standing now in an arbitrary point in open space and this is the _first state_ in an spatial-no-time unbounded 
landscape.

    - The set of _agents_ is a singleton: {Gon}

### 3.1.3. Explore and Exploit the Environment Constrained by His Vision Field
Gon has nil information about the environment. So, he can not _exploit_ its knowledge about the environment. (neither the 
landscape nor the game with the ball) He has first to _explore_ around the unbounded landscape.

Gon has in vision his most commonly used dimension of perception of his uncertain enviroment. His _vision field_ is a sensory 
source of information in which base his decision making and intentional actions to execute in the unbounded landscape. **Where 
to move** is the first agency problem he must solve.

Gon has a limited field of vision, like any human, from about 180-200 degrees horizontally determined by the combination of 
foveal (looking standing) and peripheral (looking moving head on his shoulders) visions. Therefore in any standing position in 
any time, there is a **blind zone** between 160-180 degrees that Gon is unable to see. The visual perception of movement is a 
very important factor in the mantainance of equilibrium, where peripheral vision plays the important role. 

Collecting visual information in the unbounded landscape means:
- scanning the landscape by **moving his head and checking on his shoulders** Gon is able to collect information from 
surroundings. 
- **correcting his body orientation** to see relevant **affordances** offered by the unbounded landscape 

These skills reduce Gon's blind zone constrains significantively. Gon understand the meaning of _affordances offered_ for the 
environment as "opportunities to move".

## 3.2. Gon's Local and Global Symmetry Exploration of the Unbounded Landscape
Gon will find out, in the proto space-time, **in which direction he must take to move his body**. He will perceive _the 
infinite set of_ **affordances** or _opportunities of actions in the omnidirectional open space_ that emerges and that are 
offered by the unbounded landscape.

- In any direction chosen to explore, he looks the **same scene**: 
    - an unbounded 2D plane surface. 
- All **local information** gathered in any point in the environment is **uniform and the same**.
    - This means that there is a **symmetry** in the *first-state* that Gon has to explore. This is the reason to call this 
    experience the **cosmic string** [Witten] in the unbounded, uniform landscape that exhibts an invariant **2Ï€ rotational 
    symmetry**: _"The infinite affordance"_.

Therefore, in principle, 
- _there is no need of global exploration of the unbounded field_ because any _local information_ about is the same in any 
other place and therefore, the _local information_ is in _coherence_, in entanglement with the **global_information**; because 
the environment is a _space-no-time_ fabric.

- Gon has **local and global freedom** to choose the proto-action of **move anywhere to any location near or far in an spatial-
time unbounded landscape fabric**.

Gon has founded as an organism in an environment an **organic Universe** [Bergson, Teillard, Mae-Wan Ho] and he is able to 
understand that he is the creator of an evolving process with his agency dynamics and, that a **space-time** inseparable, 
mutable **process** can be experienced and observed from inside in the open in Gon-unbounded landscape **in coherence** as a 
whole. There is an embodiness creative and participatory entanglement between Gon and an uncertain landscape.

## 3.3. Gon's Exploitation of the Constrained Unbounded Landscape
The AcEmFC's trainer throws a ball to an arbitrary location in the field and Gon understand is for him, for playing the **ball**
with his feet ,now on with the global constrain that must be explained that **football is just for play with the ball and a 
game to score goals in one out of two goals**.
### 3.3.1. A ball in stasis in a constrained unbounded landscape
- The AcEmFC's trainer created a perturbation of the first-state and evolved the system to a constrained *second-state* that 
emerges globally when **goals** and a **ball** are contained in the unbounded landscape in positional stasis. In this state, a 
**proto space-no-time** is created where there is a _conservation of momentum of the ball in stasis_ or no movement of the ball
in such any place.

    - The set of _things_ is: {goals, ball}
    - The set of _agents_ is empty: {Gon}
    - The set of _events_ is a singleton: {stasis,} = {positional_stasis,}

Here-now Gon understands that he must disturb the relativistic state of **football in stasis in an arbitrary point** all around
the **constrained unbounded landscape over an horizon of ordered events**.
### 3.3.2. Gon has to explore and identify the location of the ball with his vision field through the unbounded landscape while he is in off-possession state
- Gon is standing in an arbitrary point _p_, let us assume that the ball is located in Gon's blind zone of vision. Gon is in stasis in a universe characterized by a first state of space-no-time. The system evolves to a **third relational state** where an _agent_ with a proto-knowledge in order to _exploit_ the constrained unbounded landscape.  
    - The set of _things_ is a triple: {goals,ball}
    - The set of _agents_ is a singleton: {firstman} = {Gon}
    - The set of _events_ is a tuple: {positional_stasis,standing+exploring}

In this third-state,
- Gon knows that he, himself is a **generator of intentional own body's transformations** in the enviroment.
- Gon new exploration of the constrained unbounded landscape **breaks the rotational symmetry**.
- Now on he experience the **difference of the complete local freedom and the constrained global information**.

This experience its materialized in the sense of **sidewayness** or **laterality** and **counter-sidewayness** or **counter-
laterality** zones. Football game is about to create xG opportunities at the end-up part where an _effective contralateral 
action_ put the ball on the net of the others goal on and to block it in our goal.

The canvas for the animation is Academia Emeritense's pitch has a 105mx68m pitch. We will use for an unbounded landscape 
105mx105m dimensions.

### 3.4. Gon must gain ball location space and take control of the Ball
In this third-state emerges **space-time** because of the _possibility of a second event happening on the first thing in stasis_.
For first time, on the positional thing can **potentially act** on his own body (possibility of execute an active inference 
decided by Gon) a transformation or action decided by the consioussness Gon, the **firstman**, the monad, the player.

    - The set of _things_ is a tuple: {goals,ball}
    - The set of _agents_ is a singleton: {Gon}
    - The set of _events_ is: {stasis, transformation} = {Ball's positional-stasis, Gon's positional-change}
    
Gon creates space-time with his first **intentional skill** of football that intents to **move himself around the unbounded 
landscape for possession of the ball**. A transformation that will cause a relational state transition from **off-ball** to 
**on-ball** state. Gon has discovery that football is played mainly through **looking at the ball** and **moving to take 
possession and control of the ball**. Gon has discovered through this underlying idea of **occupy the open space** where the 
ball is or will be. Therefore, he has to develop a **set of actions** or intentional skills to execute on himself and on the 
ball in the landscape.

Gon's _positional change_ is a movement that can be classified as {standing, walking, jogging, running} to qualify the velocity
and acceleration of Gon's position from point _p_ to gain point _o_ in open space and take control of the ball.

The last cognitive lessons that Gon acquiered were that
- the _main static reference of aFICS_ are **the goals** and, 
- the _main dynamic references of aFICS_ is the **ball location** and the **direction of movement**

In his perception of the events in the landscape he must have both lessons into account.
### 3.5. The Bounded Landscape
Every body understand the need of a **perimeter** for playing in the landscape. A closed landscape to play called **bounded 
landscape**

### 3.6. The Patched Bounded Landscape
In aFootball our perspective of the game is in spatial-temporal terms. This view yields us to state that _there is an 
**architecture of the football game** in the bounded landscape. This architecture of aFICS in the bounded landscape is all 
about **creating space guided by affordances** and **coming into space at the right time**. 

Therefore, a main idea of strategy to play football in the bounded playground is about **organizing space**. A spatial 
practice in geolocalization, as in aFICS for football, to be analysed would be in terms of:
- the static framed bounded landscape or the **aBLandscape** and,
- the teams' dynamics as **Football Flow**

Let us analyse the framed bounded landscape aBLandscape as the common reference for spatial practice of football.
