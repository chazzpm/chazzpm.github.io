### 0.1. aFICS: A Culture of Innovation and Disruption
This blog is an effort to build a **culture of innovations and disruptions** [vmware-2018] based on a reflection about the
**mindset of science in football** with **machine learning ML data science** efforts and discipline to achieve:

- *Paternships* building an ecosystem focused on our costumers (talents, families, teams, tournaments, leagues) by connecting
all of them through a **new language game** and by *turning disruption into opportunities to innovate in football* together.
- *Drive* our efforts by innovating with purpose toward a *self-actualization of the aFICS vision*
- *Resilience* for our aFICS vision by embracing *change and diversity to drive innovation* in order to create an organization
capable to react to an onslaught challenges and coming out even stronger and **robust**. 
- *Foster diversity*, in a culture of innovations that has to be pervasive across everything we do, to create the *ability to
disrupt ourselves*.

### 0.2. Football as an evolutionary game where emerge a style or identity
Football is a spatial evolutionary game in which from our enterprise culture, a synergestic environment with ethical standard, 
are relevant traits that must characterize the *style or identity* of our synergons and aFICS teams.

*Synergestic* or "cooperative willingly under compromise" trait can survive the intense competition during a game and a 
tournament. If the spatial distribution allows to cooperators to interact with each other frequently, the *benefits of 
cooperation will outweight the losses due to explotation by selfish players*. However, for a synergestic behaviour to get
established in an aFICS team

- it need to be found initially in a suffuciently l*arge cluster to allow a high frequency of intra-cooperator interactions*.
- At the same time, an iterated *tit-for-tat policy* is used as ethical standard to penalize selfish defectors players.

This two criteria explain how the evolution of an aFICS team overcomes the emergence problem of collective and coherent 
cooperation. We assure those specific environmental conditions as a *silent culture of synergy and its reinforcement*. It
tolerates the recurrent presence of a neutral behavior of selfish players that does not harm or does improve the performance 
of the aFICS team immerse in the synergestic stress of our cultural environment and its ethical standard.

These ideas summarizes the **dimensions of synergestic, cognitive and intelligent football** used to develop and evolve at
Academia Emeritense FC as aFICS synergons and aFICS teams.

### 0.3. aFICS Blog: A tool at hand to expose my based on science mindset perspective
In the blog, I explore how is that we can all live in the same Football's universe yet see reality so differently. I will 
adopt science's mindset to walk through in this phenomenon with an aFICS vision.

Physics, mathematics and network science will be used to determine fundamental concepts about the game, although truth is not
enterely clear-cut.

Neuroscience indicates that our perceptions are not direct representations of the external world in the landscape. Rather each
unique brain makes guesses about reality based on the sensory signals every one receives.

The uncertainty in space-time about the horizon of ordered events in the world of a football game must be reduced by 
understanding how we instinctively deal with unknowns and how every one exploit his knowledge about the information ecosystem.
There is no other way in this multi-perspectivism about football than build consensus and mutual understanding about the 
football game.
