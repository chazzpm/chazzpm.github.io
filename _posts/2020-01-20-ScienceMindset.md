## 1.1. Gon, The First aFICS Synergon
The main role of **Academia Emeritense FC** is the _development of synergons_ or aFICS players, where being member of an 
AcEmFC's team in a pitch is just part of the extended environment where and how to play football with our identity. 

Let us assume our U5 talent name, a proactive inference agent (-on, a monad), is Gunter or Guillermo. So, let us call this 
ideal synergon **G-on**, or **Gon** as apelative and, he will be the subject of our architecture of football education. If his
name is Mauricio or Marcelo or Matias or Manuel, it would be called M-on or Mon, and the like.

## 1.2. aFootball is a Form: System of Interactions over Time in an Unbounded Landscape
**Information** is _form_. The nature of _form_ is _relations between objects_. This is the reason to conceives **science** as 
a _system_ of _relations over time_ in _space_. This multiple-Universe perspectives is the _core of the mindset of science_ 
today.

The purpose of this work is to generate the basis of a new mindset in the form of a **language game for Gon about an alter-
Football**; conceived as _a system of dynamic interactions over a time horizon on a landscape_ that first will be unbounded 
because the child meets football in the street or in the open. Later, he needs to play football in the _FIFA's framed
landscape for Football_. 

Our new _language game_ is build from the multivalent *affordances, decisions and skilled actions* that he will experience and 
execute in the **_FIFA's framed landscape_** that will be _patched_ in Academia Emeritense FC or aPitch that will become the 
canvas for **football analytics** in aNT. 

Gon plays are guided by 
- a set of affordances experienced due his wide and deep cognitive field, 
- a set of intelligent decision making and,
- a set of intentional skilled actions executed in synergy with his teammates. 

If he concentrates persistently in this play-world he will enter into "Gon's flow state" while playing and, we will be able to
do the _dynamical system of event-interactions_ analysis that happens on the aPitch as **football flow** at _every-patch and
in every-event on the pitch_.

## 1.3. Apply Classical Science Mindset to aFootball
Let us apply science mindset to the **Universe of the game of Football** conceived as a 3D infinite disk projected on a **2D 
unbounded landscape with no things, no events and _no agents**; just a *universe of eternal nothingness and stasis*. No things 
and no events means _no relations_ therefore, _no space-time_. To anneal, edify the unbounded landscape [Rovelli]. 

Physical science, the dominant classical mindset, establishes the **background structure of the world** by conceiving 
"_observables_"
- **time** as _**flow**_ and its mechanics rules are the immutable laws of _motion, velocities and accelerations_ (or evolutive
changes) that are described by _functions_ or differential equations of a _real variable_, called _time_. 
- An **horizon of ordered events or actions** or _generator of space-transformations on things_, where *horizon* means a 
_general distributed ledger of events on things caused by agents in the container_, and
- **space** as a _container framework of things and agents_ [Newton].

"_states_"
- The **state of the world** with n degrees of freedom needs 2n _imaginary variables_ called _coordinates of **phase space**_ 
to be described by a Hamiltonian theory. Its dynamics is described by a Hamiltonian function referenced by those coordinates of
phase space; and its Hamilton equation describe **changes or differences of the reference coordinates of phase space in time**.

and, a "metrics"
- A **clock** that measures _observable time_ is assumed has an _independent variable_ in the evolution of the world.

In summary, **Universe has a framework of the world** that is a 4 dimentional continuum gives us the intuition of **flowing 
time** and that **everything, everywhere flow** or changes.

Physical science mutated with special relativity - simultaneity of events - but much more with general relativity where
emerged several notions of **time**. First, the _coordinate time_ as a _field variable_. Since, all functions depend on phase 
space and time coordinates **f(q,t)**. Time keeps playing its clasical role. But, in Einstein equations - a second order 
evolution equations in t are about velocity- clocks measures along their worldline,not t. Relativistic time t has no direct
physical interpretation; it is just an arbitrary label. It is a consequence of the **invariance of Einstein equations under
changes of phase-space coordinate systems**. Therefore, solutions of Einstein equations factored away time and do not depend
on time [Rovelli].

In the physical content solved _there is no preferred independent time variable_ only describe **function relations among 
entities** - things, distances, events -. General relativity describes **the relative evolution of observables quantities**. 
Therefore, Einstein broken the Newton's universal clock [Rovelli].

## 1.4. The Latest Science Mindset: "There is only Interior and no Exterior in the Universe"
On other hand, the statement that "**there is nothing outside the Universe**" implies a formulation of **physics without 
background structure**. 

All theories of physics apply only to subsystems of the Universe; but not to the Universe as a whole, because they 
requiere this background structure. All of them are based on "the cosmological fallacy" [Smolin,Unger] that hopes theories
that apply to subsystems and scale them up to the universe as a whole. 

We need a theory of dynamics without an observer, or a measuring instrument outside the system because the universe has a 
**perimeter** [^1], an expanding one. Therefore, **there is only interior and no exterior** [Smolin]. The fundamental **monad
- Gon -** represents the universe based on his unique view of the whole universe from the interior. Reality must be build out
of viewpoints, each one a partial perspective on a dynamically evolving universe. **A universe as seen from the inside**.

Let us describe the 'structure of the world' as a 'view' based on a theory about **processes**, about the sequences and causal 
relations among things that happen.

- We need a **pace** the imaginary way of describing relationships [Leibniz],[Smolin].
- A **relational framework [The Monadology - Leibniz]**.

## 1.5. In aFootball Universe there is only interior, not exterior in a Framed Landscape
In Football universe, the **event** are the things that happen at a single place and time; at each event there’s some physical 
quantity that’s measurable. The _event_ has relations with the rest of the football universe, and that set of relations 
constitutes our _view_ of the football universe. To have complete paralellism, **football needs to be played in a framed 
landscape**.

Its classical view is the language game of journalists, espectators, fans and now in 21st century those with the language of 
sport analytics where their observations and states about a football match - inside- are ruled by an absolute time with a
duration 90 + x minutes and the dynamics of the football game is described by the external observators. In this context,
without them, no football game happened.

In other side, the professional **footballers** have always seen their Football Universe through the multiplicity of views of
themselves as the sole actors on the pitch and their observation and states of the game are build from inside. They all know
that the universe of football have no outside and they have their own 'language game'.

I will intent to take the universe of Football to study as footballers pro use to. A new machine learning approach that I must
keep in my mind because using the classical way is a cultural temptation. The idea is to try to reformulate football in terms
of these _views from the inside_, what it looks like from inside the aPitch that is the _perimeter_ and the _patched interior_
of the aFootball Universe.
