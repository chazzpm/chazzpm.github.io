## 5.1. Affordances, Landscape Fitness and aFICS Literacy

Gon is learning to explore and exploit the landscape. He is instructed to perceive the environment in behavioral terms. There
the **set of things** (goals, patch-zones, the ball) **provides oportunities for agency**, or **affordances** in order to 
answer the great question: **What is to play football?**  that only depends of his own aFICS skills and his football action 
capabilities. 

Affordances are properties of the coupled dynamical systems Gon-aPLandscape (player-patched landscape), scaled to his action
capabilities (strength, speed, reaction times, height, weight, body dimensions) and, affordances are perceived by Gon as he
learn to establish a **Gon-Landscape fit**. 

Academia Emeritense knows that its first cognitive task in Gon's aFICS footbal education is help him to acquiere the idea of
perceive the patched landscape, and later the pitch, in relation to its functionality. Its meaning is in the affordances that
provide insights in what Gon learns and how he accomplished the motor task with open inteligence that guides the decision
making process of how and when to act.

Gon and AcEmFC know that **learning a skill** must be understood as the emergence of an adaptive, functional dynamic and
constrained relation between he and his football environment fitness. This **fit** is influenced by a set of constrains,
always present, due to
- His individual biophysical, emotional, mental and psycological constrains and,
- Environmental physical, patch-inherents constrains and most important its set of affordances offered to him in any event

All of them must be used and exploited by Gon as opportunities for his agency in the aPLandscape and his actions will be
observed by the head coach HC as a metric of his basic **aFICS literacy**.

In this perspective, Gon involves understanding of his whole body (embodied) with affordances offered by the aPLandscape
(embedded) will determine his agency or task performance in the ground play. aFICS literacy is the _metric_ used during his
aFICS **synergon development process** until he left Academia Emeritense FC. Literacy must be understood by our talents as
'*being educated*' in our aFICS vision in the language game in the community.

Moreover, the perception of affordances evolves and changes as capability for skilled action improves. It is our 
responsability to offer, in the physical plant of our institution, through deliberate design facilities for enhance motor
skills improvement.

Let me help any player an aid that expand his vision of the invisible that Clement Lengled does not consider.

## 5.1. Graph Model of the Interior of the Patched Landscape

Let us move from the bounded landscape model of the aFootball Universe with a perimeter and an interior space to a more strict
idea of the empty patched landscape without perimeter and just constitued for interior space. This landscape aPLandscape has 
eighteen patch-zones {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17} and fifty five bidirectional spatial-adjacency 
relationships between patches, included 18 spatial-adjecency self-relations of the patches themselves. FThe aPLlandscape is
modeled as a network graph PL en Figure 5.1.
