## 7.1. aFootball aPLandscape is a Shape-Space Architecture
### 7.1.1. Shape Space and Shape Space of Shape Spaces in aFootball
Our aFootball **Universe is a close geometric-dinamical system**. The Universe **has only inside and a perimeter** -the bounded
landscape - but no outside. We decided to analyse **all possible geometric dynamic in the inside of a patched aPLandscape**. 
Therefore, it only contains things sentients - now, only Gon - and **order** in it is _the separation of the entities_. The key
entity is the **ball and its motion**. So, the minimal **shape** of a g-motion is **the shortest path** from an start alpha-
point to a final omega-point that it is a _vector_; but in general the fundamental shape creates a **trajectory** or a 
_multivector_. 

In summary, the aPLandscape constitutes mainly a **shape space** [Barboum]. 

Now, I would like to examine the possibility of existence of some sort of **invisible framework of reference** in which _every 
action, event or relation between entities_ that Gon can divise inside the closed Universe unfolds on it. And, we see a thing -
_the ball_ - and sentient monads - Gon now and, 22 players later on  - moving relative to each other. And in every **event** 
that happen we just capture a **relational view** of the state of the patched landscape of aFootball. Now we would like to 
focus to **ball-events data**, later .the insterest would be centered on **tracking data**

My proposal is a theory that can explain all possible _genuine relationships between genuine things_ - the ball, the perimeter, the lines demarking
special areas, and the goals - in the game, genuine relationships between thing and the sentient monads and, genuine 
relationships bewteen sentient monads and the genuine things. This is the Weltangshuung, my closed cosmology as explanation of 
**aFootball shape-space dynamics** in the **shape-space of shape-spaces** where the **orbit** of *all possible trajectories* 
could happen.

Therefore, I would like to present this **fabric of relational-shape space** as un unfolding structure of all possible events 
that can be assimilated as an **invisible, but understood framework of reference** of the aFootball game. Moreover, it will be 
the conection between our Academia Emeritense's talents, profesional players and head coaches views with those views of proper 
data science sport analytics.

### 7.1.2. Change as Difference of Shape of Ball-Trajectories

The **reality in aFootball** is the **shape of ball-trajectories** using the centroid of each patch as ideal reference of any 
point in the patch.

The **difference of shape** is a fundamental concept of **change** that distinguish events based on observable perception and 
cognition from inside of the closed Universe.  A **metrics for change or difference of shape** will be by *best matching*. It 
is the **variational principle** that can be used to handle the **evolution of the shape law** that encodes as initial 
information the view of the relational state of any **alpha point** in phase space any where when Gon goes to on-ball control 
state - **a break possession symmetry** -  and he - and his team mates - execute a possession phase whose task is build-up, 
develop and end-up into an **omega point** in any point near by the opponent goal to create an **effective Levy flight** or try
to score a goal whose outcome will be 1-out-of-m possibilities, where m:{score, miss it up, miss it left|right, kept possession,
break-possession} and viceversa. If Gon - and its team mates - lost the ball and the breaks possession symmetry set up him - 
and them - in off-ball relational state where his|their effort is oriented to re-gain possession and save the possibility of a 
conceded goal.
