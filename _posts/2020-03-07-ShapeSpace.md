## 7.1. aFootball aPLandscape is a Shape-Space Architecture
### 7.1.1. Shape Space and Shape Space of Shape Spaces in aFootball
Our aFootball **Universe is a close geometric-dinamical system**. The Universe **has only inside and a perimeter** -the bounded
landscape - but no outside. We decided to analyse **all possible geometric dynamic in the inside of a patched aPLandscape**. 
Therefore, it only contains things sentients - now, only Gon - and **order** in it is _the separation of the entities_. The key
entity is the **ball and its motion**. So, the minimal **shape** of a g-motion is **the shortest path** from an start alpha-
point to a final omega-point that it is a _vector_; but in general the fundamental shape creates a **trajectory** or a 
_multivector_. 

In summary, the aPLandscape constitutes mainly a **shape space** [Barboum]. 

Now, I would like to examine the possibility of existence of some sort of **invisible framework of reference** in which _every 
action, event or relation between entities_ that Gon can divise inside the closed Universe unfolds on it. And, we see a thing -
_the ball_ - and sentient monads - Gon now and, 22 players later on  - moving relative to each other. And in every **event** 
that happen we just capture a **relational view** of the state of the patched landscape of aFootball. Now we would like to 
focus to **ball-events data**, later .the insterest would be centered on **tracking data**

My proposal is a theory that can explain all possible _genuine relationships between genuine things_ - the ball, the perimeter, the lines demarking
special areas, and the goals - in the game, genuine relationships between thing and the sentient monads and, genuine 
relationships bewteen sentient monads and the genuine things. This is the Weltangshuung, my closed cosmology as explanation of 
**aFootball shape-space dynamics** in the **shape-space of shape-spaces** where the **orbit** of *all possible trajectories* 
could happen.

Therefore, I would like to present this **fabric of relational-shape space** as un unfolding structure of all possible events 
that can be assimilated as an **invisible, but understood framework of reference** of the aFootball game. Moreover, it will be 
the conection between our Academia Emeritense's talents, profesional players and head coaches views with those views of proper 
data science sport analytics.

## 7.2 Wisdom of the Homological Mirror Symmetry between Real and Ideal aFootball on aPLandscape
At the fronteir of physical science we have reach _a sacred knowledge_ that is present since _antiquity wisdom_: 

- There is _a homological mirror symetry between the real and the ideal world_[Frank Wilzcek].

Applied to football in the mindset of a _patched landscape_ and the _fluid performance_ it can be summarized as:

* _The shape-space-of-relations of the patched landscape tells to the players of a team _how to move_ 
    - yin:  
    > "**move the football in the same direction the longest you can**"
    
    Executing it, the football can reach the original point where the it started the movement and it is called **periodicity**
    of the symmetry in **1D real**-line direction, where all numbers are positive if they are squared x<sup>2</sup> >= 0. The 
    outcome is that the **shape-space over the horizon of ball-events fibrates** with the direction of the ball and all the 
    framed patched landscape is a _field of fibration lines_.
    
    Additionaly, the **set of relevant affordances of the patched landscapeh** invites Gon to change the direction of movement 
    or break the symmetry.
    
* _The fluid performance_ or distribution and movements of Gon and the rest of the players with respect of the ball tells to
the _shape-space-over-the horizon-of-relations in the framed aPLandscape how to curve_ or _in which new direction the football
can move on_.

    - yang: 
    > "**go to an empty space (choose the relevant affordance, an island of order and certainty) in the aPLandscape rounded by
    closed spaces of uncertainty (to minimize surprise)**"
    
    The _new direction_ is a **symmetry break**. 
    
    There is a hierarchy of fundamental breaks. **i-direction** is perpendicular to the 1D-real horizontal direction and 
    mirrors the framed landscape using the midgoals lines as reference.Therefore, *any point (x1,y1)* or coordinate of a point
    in the framed landscape is a kind of *complex number x1 + y1i and _the square of i_ or i<sup>2</sup> is -1 < 0. The final
    point (x2,y2) is other complex number x2 + y2i or vector of the symmetry break.
     
    The **shape space of shape-spaces** over an all possible ball-event horizon in football is a multidimensional hyperspace 
    holding all possibles chains of symmetry breaks or trajectories of a complex system and only need information about the
    _position_ (x1,y1) where the ball is and the _momenta_ or tangent vector directed to (x2,y2) in a system with N degrees of
    freedom.
    
### 7.1.2. Change as Difference of Shape of Ball-Trajectories

The **reality in aFootball** is the **shape of ball-trajectories** using the centroid of each patch as ideal reference of any 
point in the patch.

The **difference of shape** is a fundamental concept of **change** that distinguish events based on observable perception and 
cognition from inside of the closed Universe.  A **metrics for change or difference of shape** will be by *best matching*. It 
is the **variational principle** that can be used to handle the **evolution of the shape law** that encodes as initial 
information the view of the relational state of any **alpha point** in phase space any where when Gon goes to on-ball control 
state - **a break possession symmetry** -  and he - and his team mates - execute a possession phase whose task is build-up, 
develop and end-up into an **omega point** in any point near by the opponent goal to create an **effective Levy flight** or
try to score a goal whose outcome will be 1-out-of-m possibilities, where m:{score, miss it up, miss it left|right, kept
possession, break-possession} and viceversa. If Gon - and its team mates - lost the ball and the breaks possession symmetry 
set up him - and them - in off-ball relational state where his|their effort is oriented to re-gain possession and save the
possibility of a conceded goal.

The sequence of patch centroids of the Levy flight:  [6, 13, 4, 6, 6, 6, 12, 12, 1, 7, 8, 0, 0, 6, 1, 7, 7, 9] is shown in 
Figure 7.2; but most important is that it can be sintactically represented as a word of gamma-motions or a sequence of
interactions coded as: 
['2_73_0613', '5_5_1304', '3_30_0406', '0_6_0606', '0_6_0606', '4_28_0612', '0_12_1212', '4_27_1201', '2_39_0107', '1_35_0708', '2_44_0800', '0_0_0000', '2_30_0006', '1_23_0601', '2_39_0107', '0_7_0707', '3_44_0709']. 
Therefore, **all possible aFootball that happened in a match can be represented as a sequences of words of gamma-motion 
interaction codes**.
